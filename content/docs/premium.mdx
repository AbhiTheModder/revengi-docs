# Support Us with Premium Subscriptions or Donations

While [@RevEngiBot](https://t.me/RevEngiBot) is mostly free to use, we've had to introduce some limits on file sizes to manage our server load effectively. As a small team working passionately on this project, we don't benefit financially from it‚Äîour focus is on delivering powerful tools to the community. However, running this service incurs ongoing server costs, which led us to introduce premium subscriptions to help manage these expenses.

## Why Premium Plans?

Our goal was never to introduce paywalls, but rather to make sure we can afford to keep our services running for everyone. If we receive enough support from donations, we would be more than happy to lift all restrictions for everyone, as our aim is to keep this project as accessible as possible!

We've designed our premium plans to help cover the costs in a fair and affordable way while giving you more value for your support.
