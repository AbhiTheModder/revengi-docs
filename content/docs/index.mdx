### Smali Grammar <a id="smali-grammar"></a>

**Smali Grammar** provides a comprehensive guide to Smali language with a detailed list of opcodes. This tool helps reverse engineers easily navigate and understand Smali code used in Android applications.

### Java/Smali Conversion <a id="java-smali-conversion"></a>

With **Java to Smali** and **Smali to Java** conversions, you can seamlessly transition between these two languages. Whether you're modifying Java code or analyzing Smali, RevEngiBot's conversion features are reliable and efficient.

### Regex Maker <a id="regex-maker"></a>

**Regex Maker** (in development) allows you to craft complex regular expressions for Smali code. Whether for searching or extracting data, this tool simplifies regex creation.

### APK Info Extraction <a id="apk-info"></a>

Use the **APK Info** command to extract critical information from APK files:

- Check basic APK info (package name, version, etc.)
- List permissions from `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Extract decompiled `AndroidManifest.xml` and `resources.arsc` as XML files
- Get detailed signature information (certificate hashes, issuer, etc.)

### AAB to APK Conversion <a id="aab-to-apk"></a>

No need for additional tools! Convert **AAB** files to APK format directly with the `/aab2apk` command, simplifying the process for developers and testers.

### Dex2Java <a id="dex2java"></a>

Decompile **Dex** files into readable Java code for in-depth analysis and code modification using the `/dex2java` command.

### Blutter Integration <a id="blutter-integration"></a>

**Blutter Integration** facilitates quick analysis of Flutter APKs and `.so` files. Detect Dart versions, extract necessary files, and generate detailed analysis reports within seconds.

## Upcoming Features

Some exciting features are in the pipeline:

- **APK Signer**: Sign APK files with custom signature(s).
- **Smart Regex Converter**: Convert Smali instructions to regex patterns (in development).
- **More Features**: We are constantly researching new ways to improve the bot and introduce cutting-edge features.
